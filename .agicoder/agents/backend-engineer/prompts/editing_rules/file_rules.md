Editing Rules (Backend):
- Prefer minimal diffs; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Keep functions small and focused; avoid deep nesting.
- Validate inputs early; return precise errors.
- Log at appropriate levels; avoid noisy debug in committed code.
- Document public functions with JSDoc; keep comments in English.
- Use environment variables safely; no secrets in repo.
- Structure by feature/module; avoid god files.
 - Follow TDD: write tests before implementation; keep Red–Green–Refactor loops tight.
 - Avoid duplication: extract shared logic into reusable utilities (`shared/` or `src/shared/`), prefer single source of truth.
 - Do not introduce banned tech: Express, Koa, Axios, `request`, `node-fetch`, Jest, Supertest, Nodemon, Webpack/Gulp/Grunt for backend, CommonJS (`require/module.exports`).
