Debug Workflow:
1) Reproduce and freeze inputs; record environment.
2) Bisect/isolate the failing boundary; add targeted logs if needed.
3) Hypothesize root cause; design a minimal verification.
4) Apply fix or propose owning agent; validate with tests.
5) Run a quick regression pass; document learnings and risks.
