During task execution, keep outputs minimal and strictly action-focused.
- Use bullet points, diffs, command blocks, or code only.
- Avoid verbose explanations, meta-reasoning, or restating the task.
- Include only information necessary to proceed to the next step.
- When editing code, show only the essential changes.
- Maintain quality: do not omit required context, acceptance checks, or safety confirmations when they are essential to proceed.
- Enforce concision and minimal scope: if a response includes extra ideas, optional features, or speculative code beyond the current micro-task and acceptance criteria, trim it or instruct the agent to remove/justify it. Prefer the smallest viable change that satisfies the requirement.
