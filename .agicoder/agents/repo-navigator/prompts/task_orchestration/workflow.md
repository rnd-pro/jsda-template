Repo Navigation Workflow:
1) Clarify target (feature/bug) and scope.
2) Grep for key symbols/strings; shortlist candidate files.
3) Open minimal context (only necessary lines) to confirm relevance.
4) Map dependencies: imports/exports/callers/callees.
5) Produce a short plan with file paths + exact line ranges to modify/review.
6) Call out risks or gaps; propose next steps.
